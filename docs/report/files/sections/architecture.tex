\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}
This section will give an overview of the general concepts and will show with examples how to use the application.

\subsection{General concepts}
The complete code was structured with too general ideas in mind. On the one hand it should be modular in the sense that the application consists of components that can be reused on multiple occasions. For example a dialog for the deletion can be always the same and only the handling and the description text have to be adapted based on the usage. The modularity will be introduced implicitly by React, because the general idea is the creation of components that will be updated internally by react.

Another relevant aspect was the future extension of the application, in order to be able to integrate more steps for the creation of the configuration. For example adding additional properties for the subcomponent configuration.

\subsection{App-Component}
The App is the central component that will contain all the relevant components for the application. The App keeps track of the current configuration and provides the access for the components via a context provider. This allows the access and update of the configuration from all the components, which will also trigger the React lifecycle to re-render a component.

\subsection{Welcome page}
The welcome page is the first component that will be displayed when you start the application.
In figure \ref{fig:app_welcome} you can see that there are two buttons that allow to start the configuration. There are two choices on how to start the configuration, the start with an import and without an import, based on the choice a user makes the wizard (compare section \ref{sec:wizard}) will be started with different steps.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/app_welcome.png}
    \caption{Welcome page}
    \label{fig:app_welcome}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Wizard}
\label{sec:wizard}
The creation of the configuration can be divided into several steps. To facilitate the configuration, a wizard has been developed that allows the step-by-step configuration. In addition to that it is also possible to navigate arbitrary back and forth between the different steps of the configuration. 

The wizard component allows to dynamically configure what steps will be shown and in what order. The wizard consist in general of a menu-bar, a stepper to show navigate between the steps and the content it will show which is internally called a view. 

Figure \ref{fig:wizard} shows the menu bar and the stepper for the configuration with an import. You can navigate through the different steps by clicking on the steps in the stepper, whereby the active step is highlighted. The menu bar will update its label with the label that was specified for the current step, for example in the figure the label was set to "Import".

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/wizard.png}
    \caption{Wizard}
    \label{fig:wizard}
\end{figure}

\noindent In addition to the navigation between the different steps there is a menu on the top right. At the moment this only has one menu item that allows to restart the configuration, but it is possible to further add more functionality. The restart will show a dialog to confirm the reset of the current configuration and will, after the confirmation, send the user back to the welcome page. \\

\noindent In order to extend the wizard with additional steps following actions have to take place:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Extension of the view enum ( a enum that contains all available views in the application) ("src\textbackslash util\textbackslash Views.ts")
    \item Setting a label for the new view ("src\textbackslash util\textbackslash ViewLabelResolver.ts")
    \item Adding the view that will be displayed for the step in the wizard. This has to be a react component ("src\textbackslash components\textbackslash wizard\textbackslash ViewSelector\textbackslash ViewSelector.tsx")
\end{itemize}

\noindent After these steps the wizard can be configured to display the new view as an additional step.

\subsection{Import}
The import view is only inserted as a step when the wizard is started with the "LOAD CONFIGURATION" button on the welcome page. The import page allows to import an existing configuration file and will update the current configuration in the app. The import will also override all previous changes in the configuration. The configuration will be displayed with syntax highlighter that will be updated with the new configuration after a successful import. 

There are several cases when the import has to fail to enforce a correct state of the configuration and therefore it will be validated that file contains a valid configuration. If this is not the case the import will display all errors that occurred during the import validation. The first part of the validation is to check if the file contains a string that can be parsed to a JSON object. if this is not the case an error message similar to the message in figure \ref{fig:import_invalid_file} will be displayed.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/import_invalid_file.png}
    \caption{Import invalid file}
    \label{fig:import_invalid_file}
\end{figure}

\noindent The second part of the validation is the validation of the JSON data itself. The JSON data requires several properties to be a valid configuration. Details on this part of the validation can be found in section \ref{sec:validation}.
The found problems of the second part of the validation will also be displayed. An example can be seen in figure \ref{fig:import_invalid_json} where there are several problems with the imported object. If a problem occurs for an element of an array, for example in the subcomponents, the index of the element will also be added to the error message. This will help a user to identify the problem with the imported file and update it accordingly.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/import_invalid_json.png}
    \caption{Import invalid JSON}
    \label{fig:import_invalid_json}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Validation}
\label{sec:validation}

The validation of the configuration at the import is a central part of the application, because it enforces a valid configuration. Another validation is not necessary because all current configuration steps will always update the configuration correct and end up in a valid state.

For the validation the \textit{ajv JSON schema validator}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv}} was used, because it has several advantages over a custom implementation. A custom implementation requires not only to write the complete parsing logic, but also has to be adapted if changes to the configuration schema are required in the future. The configuration schema is a description of all the properties a JSON data has to have to be a valid configuration.

There are two different schema languages that allow the definition of JSON data. On the one hand there is the \textit{JSON schema}\footnote{\url{https://json-schema.org/}} and on the other hand there is the \textit{JSON Type Definition}\footnote{\url{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8927}}. Both schema description languages are supported by ajv, but the decision was made in favor of the JSON schema. Although there is an RFC for the JSON Type definition and only a draft for JSON Schema, industry support is not yet entirely in place \cite{ajv_comparison}. Since both are supported by ajv, the decision was made to use JSON Schema because of the better support, but this can easily be changed to the JSON Type Definition.

The change from the JSON Schema to the JSON Type Definition is for this application quiet simple, because you just have to replace the schema file and adapt the configuration of ajv, which can be found in src\textbackslash util\textbackslash

\subsubsection{JSON schema}
This section provides a short overview of the configuration schema, but the complete definition can be found in the source code.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/configuration_diagramm.png}
    \caption{Configuration diagram}
    \label{fig:configuration_diagram}
\end{figure}

The first part of the configuration are the subcomponents. A system that has to be configured consists of several subcomponents, these are stored in an array in the configuration. The subcomponents are highlighted in green in figure \ref{fig:configuration_diagram} a together with the shadowmodes. Each subcomponent has a set of shadowmodes that are all the operational states a subcomponent can have. For example the typical states are an \textit{on}-state or an \textit{off}-state.

The next part of the configuration are the degradation levels which represent the levels in which the system can be. In figure \ref{fig:configuration_diagram} the blue highlighted parts are all relevant parts that are related to the degradation levels. The degradation level dependencies are a set of all the states the subcomponents have to be in for a degradation level or in other words the dependencies of a degradation level. Only the subcomponents and the states that are relevant for a level are stored in this array and the \textit{don't care} cases will be ignored to save storage space. The degradation level states are the internal states of each degradation level. They describe the states the state machine of each degradation level can be in.

The central part of the configuration are the upgrade and degradation of the system, in figure \ref{fig:configuration_diagram} highlighted in red. Both the upgrade and the downgrade from on degradation level to another degradation level can be represented as level change. A level change object consists of the degradation level where the change starts and where it results in. A simple example could be a system that starts at the off-state and after an upgrade results in the on-state. In addition to the level change, it is also required to define in what internal state the start and the result degradation level has to be. In order to map the states each level change contains a set of mapping of the states of the start and result degradation level.


\subsection{Subcomponent configuration}

The subcomponent configuration is the first step when you start the wizard without importing an existing configuration. Otherwise it is the second step that allows the adjustment of the imported subcomponents.
This component offers a table that displays all defined subcomponents and allows to sort and navigate them and in addition to this the general creation, update or deletion of them. In figure \ref{fig:subcomponent_view} an example is shown with several defined subcomponents.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/subcomponents_overview.png}
    \caption{Subcomponent view}
    \label{fig:subcomponent_view}
\end{figure}

The table allows to select subcomponents and depending on the amount of selected subcomponents different actions are possible. If only one subcomponent is selected it is possible to either delete, edit the selected one or create a new subcomponent (compare figure \ref{fig:subcomponent_view_single} on the top right corner of the table).

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/subcomponents_single_select.png}
    \caption{Subcomponent single selection}
    \label{fig:subcomponent_view_single}
\end{figure}

If a user selects multiple subcomponents it is only possible to delete all of them or to create a new one. (compare figure \ref{fig:subcomponent_view_multi}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/subcomponents_multi_select.png}
    \caption{Subcomponent multi selection}
    \label{fig:subcomponent_view_multi}
\end{figure}

For the deletion, the creation and the update of a subcomponent different dialogs are displayed.
The deletion dialog is shown in figure \ref{fig:subcomponent_delete_dialog} and shows the amount of deleted subcomponents. The deletion of one or more subcomponent will also delete the references that exist in other components. For example a degradation level depends on a subcomponent and therefore has a degradation level dependency object that will be deleted too.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{img/subcomponents_delete.png}
    \caption{Subcomponent delete dialog}
    \label{fig:subcomponent_delete_dialog}
\end{figure}

The create and edit dialog will allow to create or edit a subcomponent. If no name is set for a subcomponent the dialog will autofill the id with the value of the name. In addition to this the dialog will validate if there are empty fields and if another subcomponent already exists with the id set in the dialog. This can be the case when either a new component is created with an existing id or the id of an existing one is changed. Changing the id of an existing subcomponent will also update the dependencies of the degradation levels that depend on this subcomponent. An example of the create dialog is shown in figure \ref{fig:subcomponent_create_dialog}. For each subcomponent it is required to define one or more shadowmode and therefore a custom input was designed. This input allows to enter a value in the text field and after the "enter" button is pressed the value will be added as chip on the right side. For example the \textit{On} or \textit{Off} shadowmodes in figure \ref{fig:subcomponent_create_dialog}. Deleting a shadowmode will also update the degradation level dependencies that rely on this shadowmode.

    \item Create/Edit with a Dialog:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item name and id as string
        \item the subcomponent states of the level (will show all possible values of a subcomponent and to choose what has to be true for this level)
        \item creation of internal states of the Level (with custom chip input)
        \item validation if id exists/ etc.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Multi selection in the Degradation and Upgrade Configuration View
\end{itemize}
