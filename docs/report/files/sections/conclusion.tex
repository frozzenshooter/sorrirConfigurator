\section{Conclusion}

In summary, the result of this project provides various functions. Using the wizard, you can navigate back and forth in the configuration and make adjustments accordingly. The configuration as such consists of several individual steps, such as the import of an existing configuration or the configuration of subcomponents. The import of an existing configuration is validated with a schema file to enforce a valid configuration in the application. Based on the subcomponents, degradation levels can be defined and inserted into a tree for the degradations or upgrades using drag and drop. For each defined degradation or upgrade, one can specify the states of the involved degradation levels in an additional step.

The code allows easy customization with new additional steps in the wizard, which also facilitates integration of React components. For the future, further adjustments are possible, for example, an extension for the import validation with additional properties, for example, to prevent cycles in the degradation level tree.
